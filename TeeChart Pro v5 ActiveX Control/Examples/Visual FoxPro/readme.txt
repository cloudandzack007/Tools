=========================
  TeeChart Pro ActiveX
   Visual FoxPro notes
=========================

When adding a TeeChart Pro ActiveX
control into a FoxPro Form, the control
properties right-click menu works only 
when the control is selected, but not 
when it is in "edit mode".

The control is in "edit mode" when it shows
a blue frame around it.

To cancel "edit mode", click anywhere on the
Form and click back the TeeChart control.
