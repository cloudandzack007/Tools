INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1) The installer will copy TeeChart
   files to the directory of your choice
   and register the teechart5.ocx Control.

**Important

Installing TeeChart Pro AX v5 leaves intact any existing
TeeChart Pro ActiveX v4 installation. Some registry modifications
are made to permit concurrent use of both controls. Either or 
both controls may be used on your PC at the same time. Projects 
built with TeeChart Pro v4 will continue to use v4. Steema supplies 
an upgrade utility, available via the TeeChart menu group, to upgrade
Visual Basic projects. We advise you make a backup first. For other
programming environments please follow the upgrade steps to upgrade
existing projects.

If at a later stage you install an earlier release of TeeChart Pro AX 
v4 (prior to version 4.0.1), you should re-install TeeChart Pro AX v5 
afterwards as some registry settings for v5 are overwritten by earlier 
v4 releases.

Use Uninstall from Windows' Add/remove software Control Panel option
and 'Restore backup' when prompted to unisntall TeeChart Pro AX v5.

----------------------------

Use of TeeChart in new projects


Installation in Visual Basic 7.xx (.NET)
-----------------------------------------

Assuming the installer has correctly registered the TeeChart Pro
Control in your machine:


2) Start a new project.
3) Select the Visual Studio Toolbox (normally located on the left 
   of the IDE) and right-mouse button click to select 'Customize
   Toolbox'. Select One or all of the TeeChart palette components
   from the list in the COM Controls page.
4) When the TeeChart component[s] is/are located on the toolbox
   you may drag and place the TeeChart component[s] onto the 
   project Form.


Installation in Visual Basic 5.0 & 6.0
---------------------------------------

2) Start a new project and select "Project-->Components"
   and "Browse..." to select the:

        TeeChart Pro ActiveX Control
	c:\yourpath\teechart5.ocx 

   This will install the TeeChart control at Visual Basic
   ToolBox ( View --> ToolBox ).

3) See the component palette, a new Pie icon representing
   the TeeChart ActiveX Control.



Installation in Visual Basic 4.0
---------------------------------

2) Start a new project and select "Tools-->Custom Controls"
   and "Browse..." to select the:

        TeeChart Pro ActiveX Control
	c:\yourpath\teechart5.ocx 

   This will install the TeeChart control at Visual Basic
   ToolBox ( View --> ToolBox ).


3) See the component palette, a new Pie icon appears representing
   the TeeChart ActiveX Control.


Note: If you want the TeeChart Pro Activex control 
      to show everytime in Visual Basic toolbox, 
      simply save a blank project named AUTO32LD.VBP
      in your Visual Basic installation folder
      after installing TeeChart in Visual Basic palette.

          
For other programming environments:
-----------------------------------

2) To make sure the TeeChart ActiveX control is 
   accessible, you can (optionally) execute this 
   command to register TeeChart Pro Activex under 
   Windows :

   regsvr32.exe c:\yourpath\teechart5.ocx

   ( regsvr32.exe is a Microsoft application in \windows\system )


========
 DEMOS:
========

(The Activex control needs to be registered before opening the demos)

Under the "Examples" folder you will find several examples 
available for Visual Basic (4, 5 and 6), Internet Explorer (3 and 4), 
FoxPro, Access and Word-97 and Excel-97 using VBA and Visual C++ 5 and 6, VJ++ v1.1 and v6 and Powerbuilder v6.

===================
Basic Chart Steps:
===================

This section will guide you to a quick start using the 
TeeChart control.

Please see the TeeChart help file ( teechart.hlp ) for
more detailed instructions and control reference.

See also the "Tutorials" documentation (in HTML format)
for extended information.


===============================
 Steps to create a new Chart:
===============================

1) Start a new project with a new Form.

2) Select "Project... Components" in Visual Basic 5
   (or "Tools...Custom Controls" in Visual Basic 4), 
   and check the "TeeChart Pro Activex Control" from
   the list of installed controls.

3) You'll see the TeeChart ActiveX Control ( the control with a 
   "Pie" Chart icon ) in Visual Basic component palette.

   Select and drop it to the Form.

   This will show you a grey panel with a "TeeChart" blue text
   title and an empty Chart.

4) Right-click the Chart control and select "Edit..." from
   the context popup menu.

5) This will show the TeeChart editor dialog.
   Every modification using this dialog repaints automatically
   the Chart control.

Now lets add a Series....

6) Click on "Add..." to show the TeeChart Gallery
   The Gallery shows the available Chart styles.   

7) Select a Chart style, for example : Bar
   (Click "Ok" or double-click "Bar" to close the Gallery)


Now you have a Bar Series on your Chart, filled with random 
values. 

These random values are shown only at design-time.

Add now points to the Bar Series manually...

8) Double-click the Form (not the Chart), to go to the
   code window:

   Private Sub Form_Load()

   End Sub

9) Fill in this code:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
    With TChart1.Series(0)
      .Clear
      .Add 100, "Apples",  vbRed
      .Add 140, "Pears",   vbGreen
      .Add 80,  "Bananas", vbYellow
    End With
   End Sub

10) Press F5 to execute the project.

The Form will show the TeeChart control with
the manually added points.

See attached demos for more complex programming.
-----------------------------------------------


===========================
Database ADO/ODBC Charting:
===========================

TeeChart Pro AX v5 replaces the use of ODBC with ADO.
ADO permits access to ODBC datasources and most TeeChart
v4 datasource code will work directly with v5 (see the
VB examples - For VC++ see the VC++ tutorial for upgrade
notes).

Data can be retrieved from ADO datasources and plotted 
in TeeChart control, both at design-time and run-time, and
both with or without programming.

To do so, you need first to have the Microsoft ADO core
components installed on your machine.

See http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado/default.htm for
more information about ADO.

Reproduce the steps from 1) to 7) on the above example
( Basic Chart Steps ).

8) On the TeeChart dialog editor, go to the "Series" tab
   and click on the "DataSource" tab of "Series1"

9) Select the "Dataset" option on the combobox.

10) Click the "New..." button to choose an ADO dataset
    or SQL query sentence.

11) Select the appropiate fields for the Series.
    For Series Labels, use a string ( char ) field.
    For Series values, use integer, datetime, floating or 
    numeric or currency fields.

12) Click "Close" to close the TeeChart-Pro editor dialog.

The Series will be populated with data retrieved from the
selected ADO dataset.

See the included ADO/ODBC demos.
-----------------------------------------------------------

CUSTOM CHARTING:
=================

The TeeChart Activex Control is a tree of objects,
each object having properties and methods.
Through modifying these objects is possible to configure
everything at runtime.

Manipulating axis, zooming, scrolling, handling click
events, changing series types, data, clipboard, printer,
etc, all is possible using TeeChart Pro.
