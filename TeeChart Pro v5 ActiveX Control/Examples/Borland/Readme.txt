====================================
 TeeChart Pro and Borland compilers
====================================

TeeChart Pro runs natively in Borland Delphi 1.0,
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and Borland C++ Builder 1.0, 3.0
4.0 and 5.0 as a native VCL component library.

Borland chose TeeChart (Standard version) as the
native charting tool for Borland Delphi 3.0 and
all later versions.

You can also use TeeChart Pro ActiveX version
in Delphi 2,3,4 and 5 and C++ Builder 3.0, 4.0 and 
5.0, but it's much preferable to use the native VCL 
version, which integrates with the other VCL 
components (TTable, TQuery, TBitmap, TClipboard, 
etc), and has a lower overhead as no ActiveX core 
files are necessary.

With the native VCL version, TeeChart code gets
linked together with your executable, so no
other files are necessary to deploy in the
destination client machines.
