Guidance notes for licensing TeeChart
=====================================

What license do I need ?
------------------------
The TeeChart Pro Developer license permits one 
developer to develop with TeeChart Pro. A TeeChart 
Pro Webserver runtime license is required only for 
a Server publishing access to a scripted Charting 
application, ie. TeeChart scriptable via an ASP 
script, DLL, ActiveX Usercontrol or equivalent 
server module. A webserver license is not required 
if the server only provides Codebase access for 
downloading the TeeChart Control.

Applied compiled application scenario
-------------------------------------
The license allows the inclusion of the 
teechart.ocx file (and user help) with a compiled 
application. The conditions of license do not 
permit that TeeChart classes/properties/methods 
are made available in an application that may be 
used to further program with those classes. That 
type of application would be considered a 
'development' tool (rather like Visual Basic 
itself, or Visual C++) and users of that 
application would be considered TeeChart 
developers and be thus subject to require a 
TeeChart developer license. An application compiled 
as a DLL with access to TeeChart properties would 
be an example of an application requiring TeeChart 
licensing when distributed. If that DLL is a server 
module only used for a web based application see 
the section below "Web server licenses".

Applied Web browser scenario
----------------------------
Clients using the Control served by a Web Server 
(via Codebase or similar) are not subject to 
purchase of a TeeChart license depending on the 
condition of use described here. In the case of a 
web browser application for which the TeeChart 
component is included as a clientside control (with 
OBJECT Codebase or similar) it is not possible to 
physically control 'application on-developability' 
as the TeeChart component is inherently an API that 
could be scripted or 'on-developed with' in a 
browser page. Where possible, the application 
developer should make it clear to his/her clientbase 
that the Control may only be used within the 
confines of his/her application. Any further 
scripting with the TeeChart Component requires a 
developer license by the scripter. 

Web server runtime licenses
---------------------------
A TeeChart Web Server license is required for each 
web server serving the Control with a serverside 
scriptable module (eg. ASP, ISAPI DLL, VB Usercontrol). 
Steema Software recognises that there are some 
technical advantages to using a compiled UserControl 
as an ActiveX Control or DLL housing the TeeChart 
Control serverside rather than use of ASP (namely 
availibility of TeeChart events serverside). For this 
specific use of TeeChart, Steema Software treat the 
compiled Control, when housing a Server based process 
only, as eligible for a Web Server runtime license and 
exempt from any additional royalties beyond the 
basic requirements already outlined in this section. 
Web Server licenses are available as a separate product 
to the Developer license, available only to licensees 
of at least one registered Developer license.
